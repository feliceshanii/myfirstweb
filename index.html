Step by Step
</h1>

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). <br> Line three baking sheets with parchment paper.<br>
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.<br> 3. Set the bowl aside for now.<br>
4. In a large bowl, use a stand mixer or a handheld mixer to beat the softened butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until they are well combined and creamy.<br>
5. Beat in the eggat a time, followed by the vanilla extract, mixing until everything is fully incorporated.<br>
6. Gradually add the flour mixture into the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until the dough is just combined. Avoid overmixing.<br>
7. Stir the chocolate chips into the dough with a spatula until they are evenly distributed.<br>
8. Roll 2–3 tablespoonfuls of dough into balls and place them on your prepared baking sheets, spaced about 2 inches apart.<br>
9. Place the sheets in the preheated oven and bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden brown. The centers may still look a little soft.<br>
10. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before moving them to a wire rack to cool completely.<br>
